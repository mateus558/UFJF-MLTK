# You can add an external dependency using the find_package() function call
# See: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html
# Note that the imported objects resulting from the find_package() depends upon
# the configuration files generated by the developer of the library.
# These imported objects can be either:
#  - variables that must be used to include directories and/or link libraries
#    with function calls like target_include_directories() and/or
#    target_link_libraries();
#  - a CMake target that must only be linked using target_link_libraries() and
#    CMake will take care of including and/or linking the appropriate
#    directories and/or libraries.
# See: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_include_directories.html
# See: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html
# For example:
# find_package(FooPackage) may import either
#  - variables: FooPackage_INCLUDE_DIRS and FooPackage_LIBRARIES
#  - target: FooPackage::FooPackage

# Within this project, you can link to this library by just specifing the name
# of the target, i.e. ${VALID_TARGET} = LibTemplateCMakeHeaderOnly. It is
# useful, however, to define an alias of this library with the scope of the
# exported library itself because (1) you will link against it with the exact
# same syntax of an imported library and (2) because names having a double-colon
# (::) are always treated as the name of either an alias or imported target. Any
# attempt to use such a name for a different target type will result in an error.
